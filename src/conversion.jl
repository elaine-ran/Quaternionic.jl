    to_euler_angles(R)

Open Pandora's Box.

If somebody is trying to make you use Euler angles, tell them no, and walk
away, and go and tell your mum.

You don't want to use Euler angles.  They are awful.  Stay away.  It's one
thing to convert from Euler angles to quaternions; at least you're moving in
the right direction.  But to go the other way?!  It's just not right.

Assumes the Euler angles correspond to the quaternion `R` via

    R = exp(Œ± ùê§/2) * exp(Œ≤ ùê£/2) * exp(Œ≥ ùê§/2)

where ùê£ and ùê§ rotate about the fixed ``y`` and ``z`` axes, respectively, so
this reprents an initial rotation about the ``z`` axis (in the positive sense)
through an angle Œ≥, followed by a rotation about the ``y`` axis by Œ≤, and a
final rotation about the ``z`` axis by Œ±.  This is equivalent to performing an
initial rotation about ``z`` by Œ±, followed by a rotation about *the rotated*
``y'`` axis by Œ≤, followed by a rotation about *the twice-rotated* ``z''`` axis
by Œ≥.  The angles are naturally in radians.

be sure to read all of [this

*especially* the very last section about opening issues or pull requests.

# Returns
- `Œ±Œ≤Œ≥::Vector{T}`

# Raises
- `AllHell` if you try to actually use Euler angles, when you could have been
  using quaternions like a sensible person.
